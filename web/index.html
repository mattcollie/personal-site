                    I have been programming since I was 14, playing around with <b>C#</b> and <b>Javascript</b>
                    since I began, ever since I started I've had a passion for writing software to solve
                    real world problems. My qualifications currently include a Diploma in Applied Computing in
                    Level 5 and 6 from Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology. I have been working at EziTracker since
